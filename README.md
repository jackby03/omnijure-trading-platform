## The Problem

Retail traders are stuck choosing between:

- **TradingView** — Great charts, zero automation, monthly fees.
- **Custom scripts** — Powerful but no UI, no visual feedback, painful debugging.
- **Institutional terminals** — Bloomberg at $24,000/year. Enough said.

There's no **free, open-source, desktop-native** platform that gives you professional charting, AI analysis, bot management, and a real-time order book — all in one window.

## The Solution

**Omnijure TDS** is a Trading Development Studio built from the ground up in C# with a custom GPU-accelerated rendering engine. No Electron. No web views. No monthly subscription. Just raw performance.

One executable. Real-time data. AI-powered analysis. Bot fleet management. A workspace you can arrange exactly how you want — like Visual Studio, but for trading.

## Features

### Real-Time Charting
Candlestick, line, and area charts rendered at 144Hz+ with SkiaSharp on OpenGL. Color-coded wicks, SMA indicators, crosshair, drawing tools, and smooth zoom/scroll. Every pixel is custom-rendered — no charting libraries, no compromises.

### AI-Powered Analysis
An integrated AI assistant that understands market context. Ask about patterns, run divergence scans across pairs, get entry/target/stop signals — all inside the platform. Pluggable LLM backend (GPT-4o, local models, or your own).

### Live Order Book & Trades
Dual-column order book with depth bars, real-time spread indicator, and a live trade feed — all streamed via WebSocket from Binance. See the market as it happens.

### Portfolio & Bot Management
Monitor multiple accounts, track active bots (Grid, DCA, Scalper), view holdings with real-time PnL, and manage datasets for backtesting. Everything in one panel.

### Positions Tracking
Open positions table with leverage badges, entry vs mark price, unrealized PnL, ROE percentage, and one-click close actions.

### Professional Workspace
Visual Studio-style docking system with diamond compass guides, tabbed panels, tab tear-off, panel resize, and floating windows. Arrange your workspace exactly how you work.
